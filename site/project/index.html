      <section class="my-4">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Robotics Traveling Van project is focused on designing and
          building two low cost, portable educational robots that demonstrate
          core control system concepts for K-12 outreach. Sponsored by Dr.
          Michael Shafer at Northern Arizona University, the project aims to
          create safe, durable, and visually engaging platforms that help
          students connect robot motion to ideas like feedback, stability, and
          actuation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team is developing two systems: Robot 1, an inverted pendulum
          robot that maintains balance while students interact with it, and
          Robot 2, a ball balancing robot that began as a ball-on-beam prototype
          and will be extended to a full ball-on-plate platform. Both robots are
          being designed to be mass producible, classroom friendly in size, and
          robust enough for repeated demonstrations in a traveling van outreach
          setting.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="my-4">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The project uses a structured engineering design process that starts
          with customer and engineering requirements, followed by a House of
          Quality, benchmarking, and literature review to select concepts for
          both robots. The team created functional decompositions, morphological
          charts, and Pugh charts to compare alternatives and choose final
          designs that balance performance, safety, and cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Robot 1, the team modeled the inverted pendulum dynamics,
          performed controller design using methods such as PID and state space
          analysis, and developed a robust frame that can survive classroom use
          and drop tests. For Robot 2, the team benchmarked ball-on-plate
          systems, derived ball-on-beam and motor torque equations, and built a
          physical ball-on-beam prototype to validate sensing, actuation, and
          control before scaling to a plate. Across both robots, the team uses
          CAD modeling, 3D printing, electronics integration, and iterative
          prototyping informed by analysis and testing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="my-4">
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <p>By the end of the project, the team intends to deliver:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two fully functional educational robots: an inverted pendulum robot
            and a ball balancing robot suitable for K-12 classroom and outreach
            demonstrations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robust, portable mechanical designs that meet size, durability, and
            safety targets, including enclosed wiring, emergency stop features,
            and impact resistant frames.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented feedback controllers (such as PID) that clearly show how
            sensor measurements and control inputs affect robot motion in real
            time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Complete documentation, including design reports, CAD drawings,
            bills of materials, wiring diagrams, and example classroom
            activities that explain the underlying engineering principles.
          </li>
          <li>
            A repeatable platform that can be manufactured in small batches for
            the Robotics Traveling Van, enabling continued use in future
            outreach and coursework.
          </li>
        </ul>
