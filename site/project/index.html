      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Robotics Traveling Van project is focused on designing and
        building two low cost, portable educational robots that demonstrate
        core control system concepts for K-12 outreach. Sponsored by Dr.
        Michael Shafer at Northern Arizona University, the project aims to
        create safe, durable, and visually engaging platforms that help
        students connect robot motion to ideas like feedback, stability, and
        actuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team is developing two systems: Robot 1, an inverted pendulum
        robot that maintains balance while students interact with it, and
        Robot 2, a ball balancing robot that began as a ball-on-beam prototype
        and will be extended to a full ball-on-plate platform. Both robots are
        being designed to be mass producible, classroom friendly in size, and
        robust enough for repeated demonstrations in a traveling van outreach
        setting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="my-4">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The project uses a structured engineering design process that starts
        with customer and engineering requirements, followed by a House of
        Quality, benchmarking, and literature review to select concepts for
        both robots. The team created functional decompositions, morphological
        charts, and Pugh charts to compare alternatives and choose final
        designs that balance performance, safety, and cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Robot 1, the team modeled the inverted pendulum dynamics,
        performed controller design using methods such as PID and state space
        analysis, and developed a robust frame that can survive classroom use
        and drop tests. For Robot 2, the team benchmarked ball-on-plate
        systems, derived ball-on-beam and motor torque equations, and built a
        physical ball-on-beam prototype to validate sensing, actuation, and
        control before scaling to a plate. Across both robots, the team uses
        CAD modeling, 3D printing, electronics integration, and iterative
        prototyping informed by analysis and testing.
      </p>

      <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
      <p>By the end of the project, the team intends to deliver:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Two fully functional educational robots: an inverted pendulum robot
          and a ball balancing robot suitable for K-12 classroom and outreach
          demonstrations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Robust, portable mechanical designs that meet size, durability, and
          safety targets, including enclosed wiring, emergency stop features,
          and impact resistant frames.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented feedback controllers (such as PID) that clearly show how
          sensor measurements and control inputs affect robot motion in real
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete documentation, including design reports, CAD drawings,
          bills of materials, wiring diagrams, and example classroom
          activities that explain the underlying engineering principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          A repeatable platform that can be manufactured in small batches for
          the Robotics Traveling Van, enabling continued use in future
          outreach and coursework.
        </li>
      </ul>
